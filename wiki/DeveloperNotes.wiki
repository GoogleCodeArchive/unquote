== Silverlight Development Setup ==

Trying to install the Silverlight 4 Tools over VS 2010 SP1 has been a real pain for me twice. The first time, and then again after uninstalling the VS 11 Developer Preview corrupted my VS 2010 SP1 setup.

The best luck I have had is:

  # Repair/reinstall SP1 through appwiz.cpl (if you have no reason to suspect your SP1 installation is corrupt, then this step may be skipped)
  # Download Microsoft Silverlight 4 Tools for Visual Studio 2010 (http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=18149). Unzip it (even though it is an exe; running the exe gives me errors sometimes. even if it does succeed, probably didn't install the F# SL tools). Run FSharpRuntimeSL4.msi. Run silverlight_developer.exe. Run silverlight_sdk.msi.

== NuGet Packages ==

Be very careful about making sure all package metadata is correct before uploading a package (for example, icon and description). See http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/2097.
