  * Issue 8: Decompiler Bug: empty list error
  * Issue 10: Type.FSharpName bug: can't handle types in modules

== v1.2.1, 2/15/11 ==

Fix bug: local lambdas represented as Value fail during Application reduction rebuild.

== v1.2.0, 2/13/11 ==

Added `raises<'a when 'a :> exn> : Quotations.Expr -> unit` for testing expected exceptions.

== v1.1.0, 2/11/11 == 

Better support for exceptions within tests, expand support for more expressions

  * Better support for exceptions within tests: print printable lines up until the exception, then print the exception (before only printed the exception)
  * Support applications of lambda values (e.g. local function vs. module property)
  * Better preservation of type information for reduction evaluations which return null
  * Print "()" for function calls which 1) do not need explit type arguments 2) take only single unit arg
  * Changed FSI-mode Operator.test output to be more like unit test mode output; no longer uses tabs

== v1.0.0, 2/08/11 ==
